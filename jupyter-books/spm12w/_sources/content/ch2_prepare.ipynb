    "To begin using SPM12, it is necessary to have BIDS compliant directory stored under the study's rawdata directory (see above). The easiest way to generate one is to use __spm12w_prepare.m__.

Essentially, this script wraps __dicm2nii.m__ to facilitate the conversion to BIDS.\n",

    "When run from the root of the study directory (e.g., tutorial_data), __spm12w_prepare.m__ will look for a dicom or par/rec directory and provide a list of archives for conversion (either tar.gz or zip). For __spm12w_prepare.m__ to determine the appropriate naming for each subject, the archives must be named according to the following convention. \n",

When set to true, it will force open the bids GUI allowing the user to edit names and skip any aborted runs etc. We've found that manual intervention is almost always warranted (i.e., to skip aborted runs or fix naming issues) and so the default for bidsgui is true.\n",

Firstly, the BIDS validator expects a BIDS compliant participant.tsv and json file that contains information about each participant.
