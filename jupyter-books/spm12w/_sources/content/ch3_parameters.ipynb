If you decide to store your diary and personal photographs inside a subject's FUNCTIONAL or ANATOMICAL directory, you will lose them. p.overridedel = 0 will cause SPM12 to ask you for confirmation prior to deleting prior data directories.

    "The study contrasts file specifies the type of contrast to perform on the conditions from the GLM. Contrasts are zero padded to fill in nuisance regressors. This is especially useful in situations where the number of regressors in the model differs per subject (e.g. if p.outliers = 1) or for mixed designs and FIR models where the number of regressors can easily reach 100 (see CON\\_H8TJAZZ\\_MIXED.m for an example of some tricks for making organized contrast vectors for a state-item study). The way this works is that SPM12 will searche through the regressor names and count the number of 'r' regressors (which is the name we reserve for nuisance regressors). It is therefore important to keep in mind that this 'trick' will fail if you hack in any custom nuisance regressors and don’t name them 'r'.
